# ESP-IDF USB to BT/BLE HID Device

This project use APIs which esp_hid component provided to create a BT, BLE or Bluetooth dual mode hid device translating USB HID devices.

## Build instructions

Before project configuration and build, be sure to set the correct chip target using:

```bash
idf.py set-target <chip_name>
```

### Hardware Required

* A development board with ESP32 SoC (e.g., ESP32-DevKitC, ESP-WROVER-KIT, etc.)
* A USB cable for Power supply and programming

See [Development Boards](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits) for more information about it.

### Configure the Project

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output.

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://idf.espressif.com/) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
